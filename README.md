# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease using patient data.  

# 📁 Dataset

The dataset is retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes features such as:

- Demographics (e.g., age, sex)
- Medical measurements (e.g., resting blood pressure, cholesterol)
- Exercise-related results
- Diagnosis target: presence of heart disease (num)

## 📊 Models Used

We trained and evaluated 6 classification models:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  

Each model underwent hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## ⚙️ Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (categorical encoding, missing value handling)
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning
- Accuracy comparison on training and testing sets
- Comparison table of model performance
